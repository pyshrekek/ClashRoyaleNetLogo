After getting the map and game UI created, we brainstormed on how we would implement card dragging. Most of the time we spent today was polishing this mechanic so that it would drag smoothly and not allow you to drag multiple cards at the same time. We also implemented monitors for tower health and crown counts, and started testing how troops would work when placed on the ground.
