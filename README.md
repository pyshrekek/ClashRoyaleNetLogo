- [ ] card attacks
- [ ] tower pathing
    - Use SlimeMold like pheromone pathing

    - Make decks a rectangle with a netlogo vector shape (importing actual card images is very janky and does not work as a turtle)
    - Assign each card in the deck an appropriate vector shape that makes some degree of sense. (Person is giant) (person on wolf is HOG RIDEEEER)
